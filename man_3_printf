_printf(3) - Linux man page

Name:
printf

Synopsis:
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

Description:
The function _printf() produces an output according to a format and writes the output to stdout, the standard output stream.
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed. This excludes the null byte used to end output strings.
If an output error occurs, a negative value is returned.

The format string is composed of zero or more ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output.
In this function certain conversion specifications result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
