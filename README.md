Project: C - printf
In this project, Crystal, Zib, and Santana are creating our own printf function
In this function we will be producing an output according to the format prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
This should return the number of characters printed.
For the prototype to work the main.h header file is created and implemented in the project.
